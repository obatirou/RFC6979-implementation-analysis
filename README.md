## RFC6979 implementation analysis

**TLDR**:
This repository investigates differences in RFC6979 implementations across different cryptographic libraries, specifically focusing on how message hash reduction affects deterministic signature generation.
Key findings show that `noble-curves` performs modular reduction of the message hash before generating the deterministic nonce k, while `RustCrypto` and `eth-keys` perform this reduction after nonce generation. This leads to different signatures when the message hash is equal to or greater than the curve order.
The cause is that the message hash is an input to the HMAC function for the generation of k. The reduction have an influence on the input hence the results of the generation.

## Investigation Details
This issue was found following this https://github.com/verklegarden/crysol/issues/23#issuecomment-2451687926:  
The signature generated by `noble-curves` for certain test vectors was different from the signature generated by foundry.
It lead to investigate the `noble-curves` library and how foundry generates the signature. It uses the `RustCrypto` library under the hood. `Noble-curves` and `RustCrypto` libraries were compared to the reference implementations [eth-keys](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-keys/tree/d8d1ecc6e159dd1dd7b12d7a203f8a276fa2a8ba).

### Key Implementation Differences
In [`weierstrass.ts from noble curves`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves/blob/e0ad0530f64d7cc01514b65d819b7f76db5f0da4/src/abstract/weierstrass.ts#L1052):
```ts
 const h1int = bits2int_modN(msgHash); // <- here is the reduction
 const d = normPrivateKeyToScalar(privateKey);
 const seedArgs = [int2octets(d), int2octets(h1int)]; // <-  passed to the seed for HMAC
```

See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979#section-3.2  
The seed for the deterministic nonce k is generated by concatenating the private key and the message hash
```
3.2.  Generation of k
Given the input message m, the following process is applied:

   a.  Process m through the hash function H, yielding:

          h1 = H(m)
...
    d.  Set:
        K = HMAC_K(V || 0x00 || int2octets(x) || bits2octets(h1))
```

For `RustCrypto` the message hash is used directly in the seed generation and not reduced:
https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/blob/89232d6a962a199fd8211a117db74408353e4383/ecdsa/src/hazmat.rs#L103
```rust
fn try_sign_prehashed_rfc6979<D>(
        &self,
        z: &FieldBytes<C>,
        ad: &[u8],
    ) -> Result<(Signature<C>, Option<RecoveryId>)>
    where
        Self: From<ScalarPrimitive<C>> + Invert<Output = CtOption<Self>>,
        D: Digest + BlockSizeUser + FixedOutput<OutputSize = FieldBytesSize<C>> + FixedOutputReset,
    {
        let k = Scalar::<C>::from_repr(rfc6979::generate_k::<D, _>(
            &self.to_repr(),
            &C::ORDER.encode_field_bytes(),
            z,                             // <- here the msgHash is used directly
            ad,
        ))
        .unwrap();

        self.try_sign_prehashed::<Self>(k, z)
    }
```
The reduction is only performed after the k is generated:  
https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/blob/89232d6a962a199fd8211a117db74408353e4383/ecdsa/src/hazmat.rs#L239
```rust
pub fn sign_prehashed<C, K>(
    d: &Scalar<C>,
    k: K,
    z: &FieldBytes<C>,
) -> Result<(Signature<C>, RecoveryId)>
where
    C: PrimeCurve + CurveArithmetic,
    K: AsRef<Scalar<C>> + Invert<Output = CtOption<Scalar<C>>>,
    SignatureSize<C>: ArrayLength<u8>,
{
    // TODO(tarcieri): use `NonZeroScalar<C>` for `k`.
    if k.as_ref().is_zero().into() {
        return Err(Error::new());
    }

    let z = <Scalar<C> as Reduce<C::Uint>>::reduce_bytes(z); // <- msghash is reduced here only after the k gerneration

    // Compute scalar inversion of ùëò
    let k_inv = Option::<Scalar<C>>::from(k.invert()).ok_or_else(Error::new)?;

    // Compute ùëπ = ùëò√óùëÆ
    let R = ProjectivePoint::<C>::mul_by_generator(k.as_ref()).to_affine();

...

    Ok((signature, recovery_id))
}
```

For `eth-keys` the message hash is also reduced after the nonce generation:  
https://github.com/ethereum/eth-keys/blob/d8d1ecc6e159dd1dd7b12d7a203f8a276fa2a8ba/eth_keys/backends/native/ecdsa.py#L124
```python
def ecdsa_raw_sign(msg_hash: bytes, private_key_bytes: bytes) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    z = big_endian_to_int(msg_hash)
    k = deterministic_generate_k(msg_hash, private_key_bytes) # <- here the msgHash is used directly

    ...

def deterministic_generate_k(
    msg_hash: bytes,
    private_key_bytes: bytes,
    digest_fn: Callable[[], Any] = hashlib.sha256,
) -> int:
    v_0 = b"\x01" * 32
    k_0 = b"\x00" * 32

    k_1 = hmac.new(
        k_0, v_0 + b"\x00" + private_key_bytes + msg_hash, digest_fn
    ).digest()
    v_1 = hmac.new(k_1, v_0, digest_fn).digest()
    k_2 = hmac.new(
        k_1, v_1 + b"\x01" + private_key_bytes + msg_hash, digest_fn
    ).digest()
    v_2 = hmac.new(k_2, v_1, digest_fn).digest()

    kb = hmac.new(k_2, v_2, digest_fn).digest()
    k = big_endian_to_int(kb)
    return k
```

After careful review of the test vectors that were leading different signature depending on the library used, it was found they shared one similarity: the message hash was greater or equal to the `secp256k1` curve order `0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141`

Here are the 3 vectors:

```rust
(
    hex!("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"), // privateKey
    hex!("ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"), // msgHash
),
(
    hex!("fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364140"),
    hex!("ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"),
),
(
    hex!("fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364140"),
    hex!("fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141"),
)
```

When signing the messages with the corresponding private keys, RustCrypto and eth-keys generated the same signature, while noble-curves generated a different one.

According to the [RFC6979 rational](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979#section-3.5),
```
... the truncated H(m) could be externally reduced modulo q,
since that is the first thing that (EC)DSA performs on the hashed
message.  With the definition of bits2octets, deterministic (EC)DSA
can be applied with the same input.
```

This is what `noble-curves` is implementing but this leads to a different signature for the same message hash and private key when the message hash is greater or equal to the curve order breaking the deterministic nature of the signature.

It means either the RFC is not strict enough or there is a misinterpretation of the RFC.
One thing is certain, libraries need to be aware of this issue and implement a fix.

*Note:  
it seems `RustCrypto`is now doing the reduction before the k generation.

This was introduced by this PR https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/pull/793  
This is not release yet in master at commit 8f93676ea0fcefe3787b805a9b35afa722b7a5c6*

## POC
Scripts were written to compare the generation of k and values that are needed for the signature but also the signatures themselves.
Those scripts showing the difference of signatures between `nobles-curves` and `RustCrypto`/`Eth-key` can be replicated by running the following commands:  

Requirements
* `rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)`
* `Python 3.10.11`
* `node v18.16.1`
* `uv 0.4.7 (a178051e8 2024-09-07)`

Installation:
* `npm install`
* `cargo install`
* [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

Running tests:
* `cargo run --quiet` for RustCrypto
* `npx ts-node-esm noble-curves.ts` for noble-curves
* `uv run python eth-key-rfc6979.py` for eth-key

Debugging:
* in vscode, the `launch.json` file can be used to debug the `noble-curves.ts` showing the reduction of the message hash before the k generation.

To fix the difference you can change the following line [`weierstrass.ts from noble curves`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves/blob/e0ad0530f64d7cc01514b65d819b7f76db5f0da4/src/abstract/weierstrass.ts#L1052)
```ts
 const seedArgs = [int2octets(d), msgHash]; // <-  msgHash is passed directly now
```
Note that this breaks several tests from noble curves outside of the `secp256k1` tests.

## Conclusion
After contacting [SEAL911](https://github.com/security-alliance/seal-911), @pcaversaccio responded in under 5min. Discussing with @paulmillr, he raised a point I overlooked:
the input of the HMAC function is the message hash but passing through the `bits2octets` function.

```
          K = HMAC_K(V || 0x01 || int2octets(x) || bits2octets(h1))
```

By looking into the definition of `bits2octets`, it is clear that the message hash needs to be reduced *before* the k generation.
```
2.3.4.  Bit String to Octet String

   The bits2octets transform takes as input a sequence of blen bits and
   outputs a sequence of rlen bits.  It consists of the following steps:

   1.  The input sequence b is converted into an integer value z1
       through the bits2int transform:

          z1 = bits2int(b)

   2.  z1 is reduced modulo q, yielding z2 (an integer between 0 and
       q-1, inclusive):

          z2 = z1 mod q

       Note that since z1 is less than 2^qlen, that modular reduction
       can be implemented with a simple conditional subtraction:
       z2 = z1-q if that value is non-negative; otherwise, z2 = z1.
```
This is exactly what `noble-curves` is doing. So `RustCrypto` and `Eth-key` are in fact missing this step and are not strictly following the RFC.
This lead to creating issues on the repositories of libraries that were concerned about this issue.
* https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/328
* https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/issues/1100
* https://github.com/ethereum/eth-keys/issues/101

`RustCrypto` already implemented the fix on master (see note in the previous section) BUT did not released it yet.
`Foundry` is still using the tag ecdsa/0.16.9 which is concerned by the issue.
In the end there is no security risks. Only thing is that the signature is not really deterministic (for some special cases).
